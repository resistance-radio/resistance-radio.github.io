<h1>Resistance Radio</h1>

<p>Resistance Radio, was an online complement to an <a href="https://interferencearchive.org/">Interference Archive</a> exhibit titled <a href="https://interferencearchive.org/exhibition/resistance-radio-the-peoples-airwaves/">Resistance Radio</a>, which ran from July 11th to September 29th, 2019. The exhibit showcased the power of radio in the service of social movements and underrepresented communities. We shared stories of people, stations and organizations from around the world who have battled the system to bring their diverse programming onto the airwaves.</p>

<p>The site was a LAMP stack running on a Digital Ocean droplet, which cost a certain amount of money each month. It was shut down in 2022 to avoid the monthly cost and environmental toll of running a server 24/7.</p>  

<p>The site has been archived in two locations</p> 

<p>The most dymnamic and complete version can be seen hosted as WARC files in the web archiving service, Conifer. <a href="https://conifer.rhizome.org/resistance/resistance-radio/20220703142847/https://resistanceradio.online/">See Resistance Radio in Conifer here</a>.</p>

<p>You can also view this site in the Internet Archive Wayback machine, which should have copies of each page but may have less complete dynamic content within each page. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220703150221/https://resistanceradio.online/">See Resistance Radio in the Wayback Machine here</a> </p>

<p>This exhibition was organized by Interference Archive volunteers Celia Easton Koehler, Charlie Muller, Dylan Flesch, Elena Levi, Kelly Mill, Louise Barry, Natalie Kerby, and Rob Smith. Poster design by Peter Kaplan.</p>
