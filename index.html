<h1>Resistance Radio</h1>

<p>Resistance Radio, was an online complement to an <a href="https://interferencearchive.org/">Interference Archive</a> exhibit titled <a href="https://interferencearchive.org/exhibition/resistance-radio-the-peoples-airwaves/">Resistance Radio</a>, which ran from July 11th to September 29th, 2019. The exhibit showcased the power of radio in the service of social movements and underrepresented communities. We shared stories of people, stations and organizations from around the world who have battled the system to bring their diverse programming onto the airwaves.</p>

<p>The site was a simple WordPress instance set up on a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP) running on an Ubuntu 18.04 server hosted in Digital Ocean. As is typical for a website, the main cost was not the domain (a nominal fee per year), but the cost of running the server. For this reason, the server was shut down in 2022. For now, I'll continue to maintain the domain with this static page as a pointer to a couple archived versions of the site below.</p>  

<p>The site has been archived in the two locations below</p> 

<p>The most dymnamic and complete version can be seen hosted as WARC files in the web archiving service, Conifer. <a href="https://conifer.rhizome.org/resistance/resistance-radio/20220703142847/https://resistanceradio.online/"><b>See Resistance Radio in Conifer here</b></a>.</p>

<p>You can also view this site in the Internet Archive Wayback machine, which should have copies of each page but may have less complete dynamic content within each page. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220703150221/https://resistanceradio.online/"><b>See Resistance Radio in the Wayback Machine here</b></a> </p>

<p>This exhibition was organized by Interference Archive volunteers Celia Easton Koehler, Charlie Muller, Dylan Flesch, Elena Levi, Kelly Mill, Louise Barry, Natalie Kerby, and Rob Smith. Poster design by Peter Kaplan.</p>
